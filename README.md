In the sport of baseball, the importance of pitcher fatigue is rapidly being realized. The number of complete games has dwindled significantly as managers become more and more aggressive with bringing in relief pitchers and minimizing unfavorable batting matchups.

By extension, being able to fatigue opposing pitchers creates a perverse incentive to burn through relief pitchers and force managers into the uncomfortable decision of whether to keep pitchers on the mound or to remove them from the game. This project aims to show the root causes of extended pitching matchups in order to better optimize for or against attriting opposing teams.

Attached are a series of java files (and will be an R document) and a set of .csv files. Driver1 is used to merge the 5-6 day long data sets into one large set (that can be sorted in excel) and Driver2 is used to compile that one large set into the list of at-bats that this analysis aims to use. 

Statcast data is publicly available via Baseball Savant, but its cap of 25000 results per .csv mandates manually stitching together the results. The data cleaning to date has been by far the most difficult part of this project.
